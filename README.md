# ahk_utilities
Every time I start a new AHK project, I always end up rewriting some of these tools. Might save you a few precious seconds.

General reference: https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/commands/

###### getColorAtMousePos
Makes a popup with coords and color. Uses AHK's RGB format but can be changed to BGR for use with other methods. Start with CTRL+X, exit script with CTRL+C.

###### getWinInfo
Makes a popup with some window info. Start with CTRL+X, exit script with CTRL+C.

###### mousePosClick
Sends a mouse click at the current location every half second. Simple but nice to not write this literally every time i make a project. Start with CTRL+X, pause with CTRL+Z, exit script with CTRL+C.
